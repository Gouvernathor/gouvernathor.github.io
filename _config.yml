      help_constructivism1: "Pourquoi les gens sont-ils comme ils sont ? Cet axe permet de vous situer entre deux pôles antagonistes répondant à cette question."
      help_constructivism2: "Les <b>constructivistes</b> estiment qu’un individu se construit à partir de son environnement (notamment social), que les caractères qui le composent sont acquis."
      help_constructivism3: "À l’inverse, les <b>essentialistes</b> partent du principe qu’un individu est par nature tel qu’il est, et que les caractères qui le composent sont innés."
      help_justice1: "Les partisans de la <b>justice réhabilitative</b> estiment que le rôle de la Justice est de remettre les condamnés dans le « droit chemin », en leur faisant comprendre pourquoi ils ne doivent pas faire ce pour quoi ils ont été condamnés, et en les accompagnant tout au long de ce processus."
      help_justice2: "À l’inverse, les partisans de la <b>justice punitive</b> partent du principe que le rôle de la Justice est dissuasif, à la fois pour les condamnés (pour éviter la récidive) et pour le reste de la société (en faisant des condamnés des exemples à ne pas suivre)."
      help_progressism1: "Les <b>progressistes</b> cherchent à instaurer un progrès social, à améliorer la société, sans se soucier des traditions. Ils estiment souvent l’époque présente comme meilleure que celles passées, et qu’il est nécessaire de poursuivre dans cette lancée."
      help_progressism2: "À l’inverse, les <b>conservateurs</b> cherchent à garder le statu quo, voire à rétablir certaines valeurs établies jugées disparues ou en perdition. Les traditions, parmi lesquelles l’héritage religieux, sont mises en avant comme source de sagesse."
      help_internationalism1: "<b>L’internationalisme</b> est un ensemble d’idées hétéroclites ayant pour point commun de ne pas hiérarchiser les pays et leurs habitants entre eux, et à promouvoir autant que possible leur coopération. Poussé à son maximum, l’objectif final de l’internationalisme est l’abolition des frontières."
      help_internationalism2: "À l’inverse, le <b>nationalisme</b> est un ensemble d’idées hétéroclites ayant pour point commun de privilégier le pays et les habitants dans lequel il s’applique par rapport aux autres, et à légitimer l’existence d’une nation par peuple."
      help_communism1: "Le <b>communisme</b> est une doctrine politique très vaste. Dans ce test, une prépondérance pour le communisme signifie simplement que vous êtes partisans de la propriété publique des moyens de productions."
      help_communism2: "Le <b>capitalisme</b> est lui aussi un concept très ambivalent. Dans ce test, une prépondérance pour le capitalisme signifie simplement que vous êtes partisans de la propriété privée des moyens de productions."
      help_regulationism1: "Cet axe représente l'attitude que doit avoir un état dans une économie de marché où une part importante des moyens de production sont privés. Libéraux et keynésiens s’opposent ainsi sur la méthode à adopter sans toutefois remettre en question le capitalisme. Si vous êtes plutôt capitaliste, cet axe représente votre but en matière d’économie. Si vous êtes communiste, cet axe représente ce que vous pouvez attendre de moins mauvais du système actuel."
      help_regulationism2: "Le <b>régulationnisme</b>, ou interventionnisme, est une idée selon laquelle l’activité économique doit être régulée dans l’intérêt de tous. Cela peut passer par la législation, la planification, les subventions, une imposition variable…"
      help_regulationism3: "À l’inverse, le <b>laissez-faire</b> est une idée selon laquelle l’activité économique ne doit pas être régulée, car elle répondrait d’elle-même à l’intérêt général. Cela peut passer par une faible législation, peu ou pas de subventions, une imposition fixe et souvent faible, voire la suppression complète du rôle de l’État en matière d’économie."
      help_ecology1: "<b>L’écologie</b>, en politique, privilégie la protection de l’environnement, en limitant autant que possible l’impact des activités humaines sur la biodiversité, quitte à limiter au passage lesdites activités humaines en modifiant plus ou moins radicalement le mode de vie actuel."
      help_ecology2: "Le <b>productivisme</b> privilégie les besoins humain, notamment en soutenant la hausse de la production ou l’utilisation de méthodes ayant un impact incertain sur l’environnement."
      help_revo1: "Les <b>révolutionnaires</b> auront tendance à privilégier l’action directe, souvent en marge de la légalité, pour parvenir à leur objectifs, afin de remplacer l’organisation politique actuelle par une autre radicalement différente. Cela peut se faire au travers de la guérilla, ou plus généralement par des méthodes qui sortent du cadre de l’acceptable posé par les institutions politiques…"
      help_revo2: "Les <b>réformistes</b> auront tendance à privilégier l’action légale pour parvenir à leurs fins, afin de réformer l’organisation politique actuelle petit à petit. Cela peut se faire au travers des institutions, via les élections, les manifestations autorisées, les pétitions…"
