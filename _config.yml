      help_progressism2: "Die <b>Konservativen</b> bevorzugen den sog. Status Quo. Manchmal fordern sie sogar eine Rückkehr zu (oder den Schutz von) bestimmten Werten, die bedroht sind oder in der Vergangenheit liegen. Diese können religiös, oder auch historisch geprägt sein."
      help_internationalism1: "Der <b> Internationalismus</b> beinhaltet viele Ideenströmungen, die in bestimmten Zielen übereinstimmen: Kooperation zwischen Ländern, ohne das eigene Land vorteilhaft zu sehen und behandeln. Die Menschen und Bevölkerungen verschiedener Nationen werden nicht hierarchisch gesehen, sondern als gleich wichtig. Eine der extremeren Ideen ist die Forderung mancher Internationalisten, eine alle Grenzen vollständig abzuschaffen.\"."
      help_internationalism2: " Die <b>Nationalisten</b> streben nach dem Wohlsein des eigenen Staates und dessen Bevölkerung. Sie streben nach der Erhaltung einer nationalen Identität. Ihre Interessen sind national zentriert und rechtfertigen die Schaffung eines Staates für ein bestimmtes Volk "
      help_communism1: "Der <b>Kommunismus</b> ist ein sehr politisch breites Feld. In diesem Test illustriert dieser Wert nur, dass Sie dafür sind, die Produktionsmittel ins öffentliche Eigentum zurückzukehren, sei es staatlich oder kollektiv."
      help_communism2: "Der <b>Kapitalismus</b> ist ebenfalls ein ambivalentes Konzept. In diesem Test bedeutet es nur, dass Sie gegen die Aufhebung des Privatseingentum der Produktionsmittel sind."

Wenn Sie eher für den Kapitalismus sind, deutet diese Achse an, welche Vorgehensweise sie bevorzugen. Wenn sie ein Kommunist sind, dann zeigt diese Achse lediglich, welche der beiden Vorgehensweisen sie als weniger schädlich sehen."
      help_regulationism2: "Die <b>Marktregulierung</b> setzt eine gewisse Regulierung der Wirtschaft durch den Staat voraus, weil jedes Individuum von der Wirtschaft profitieren dürfen und können sollte. Befürworter glauben, man könne dies erreichen, indem man Maßnahmen wie zum Beispiel Planung, Gesetze, Subventionen oder auch anpassbare Steuern durchsetzt."
      help_regulationism3: "Dagegen ist das sog. <b>laissez-faire</b> eine wirtschaftliche Doktrine, die ausdrücklich gegen die Einschreitung des Staates in der Wirtschaft ist, weil diese von selbst her auf das gemeinsame Interesse abzielt. Praktisch verlangen Befürworter Sachen wie eine schwachen Gesetzgebung, niedrige Steuern, bis hin zur Abschaffung der Rolle des Staates in der Wirtschaft."
      help_ecology1: "Ökologische Politik bevorzugt den Schutz der Umwelt, indem sie versucht die Auswirkungen der menschlichen Aktivitäten auf die Artenvielfalt so weit wie möglich zu begrenzen, auch wenn das bedeutet unsere aktuelle Lebensweise zu verändern."
      help_ecology2: "Der <b>Produktivismus</b> kümmert sich hauptsächlich um die menschlichen Bedürfnisse. Der Produktivismus lässt sich anhand des Verlangens nach einer Steigerung der Produktion oder der Benutzung von technischen Mitteln erkennen, welche die Gefährdung oder Zerstörung der Umwelt in Kauf nehmen."
      help_revo1: "Die <b>Revolutionären</b> meinen, Direkte Aktion wäre der beste Weg, die politische Ordnung neu und radikal umzugestalten. Diese Aktionen sind oft am Rande der Legalität, und werden von den gegenwärtigen Institutionen kaum akzeptiert."

      help_constructivism2: "Les <b>constructivistes</b> estiment qu’un individu se construit à partir de son environnement (notamment social), que les caractères qui le composent sont acquis."
      help_constructivism3: "À l’inverse, les <b>essentialistes</b> partent du principe qu’un individu est par nature tel qu’il est, et que les caractères qui le composent sont innés."
      help_justice1: "Les partisans de la <b>justice réhabilitative</b> estiment que le rôle de la Justice est de remettre les condamnés dans le « droit chemin », en leur faisant comprendre pourquoi ils ne doivent pas faire ce pour quoi ils ont été condamnés, et en les accompagnant tout au long de ce processus."
      help_justice2: "À l’inverse, les partisans de la <b>justice punitive</b> partent du principe que le rôle de la Justice est dissuasif, à la fois pour les condamnés (pour éviter la récidive) et pour le reste de la société (en faisant des condamnés des exemples à ne pas suivre)."
      help_progressism1: "Les <b>progressistes</b> cherchent à instaurer un progrès social, à améliorer la société, sans se soucier des traditions. Ils estiment souvent l’époque présente comme meilleure que celles passées, et qu’il est nécessaire de poursuivre dans cette lancée."
      help_progressism2: "À l’inverse, les <b>conservateurs</b> cherchent à garder le statu quo, voire à rétablir certaines valeurs établies jugées disparues ou en perdition. Les traditions, parmi lesquelles l’héritage religieux, sont mises en avant comme source de sagesse."
      help_internationalism1: "<b>L’internationalisme</b> est un ensemble d’idées hétéroclites ayant pour point commun de ne pas hiérarchiser les pays et leurs habitants entre eux, et à promouvoir autant que possible leur coopération. Poussé à son maximum, l’objectif final de l’internationalisme est l’abolition des frontières."
      help_internationalism2: "À l’inverse, le <b>nationalisme</b> est un ensemble d’idées hétéroclites ayant pour point commun de privilégier le pays et les habitants dans lequel il s’applique par rapport aux autres, et à légitimer l’existence d’une nation par peuple."
      help_communism1: "Le <b>communisme</b> est une doctrine politique très vaste. Dans ce test, une prépondérance pour le communisme signifie simplement que vous êtes partisans de la propriété publique des moyens de productions."

      help_justice1: "Те, кто выступают за <b>реабилитационное правосудие</b> считают, что роль правосудия заключается в том, чтобы снова поставить осуждённого на «правильный путь», заставив их понять, почему они не должны делать то, что они сделали, и почему они были осуждены."
      help_justice2: "И наоборот, те, кто выступает за <b>карательное правосудие</b> считают, что роль правосудия должна быть сдерживающей как для осужденных (чтобы избежать рецидивизма), так и для остальной части общества (делая их примерами, которым не стоит следовать)."
      help_progressism1: "<b>Прогрессивисты</b> ставят целью социальный прогресс, созидание более совешенного общества без оглядки на традиции. Они зачастую считают, что настоящее лучше прошлого и что важно продолжать идти по этому пути."

      help_regulationism3: "<b>Принцип невмешательства</b>, наоборот, поддерживает идею, что хозяйственная деятельность не должна регулироваться, потому что сама по себе соответсвует общественным интересам.
